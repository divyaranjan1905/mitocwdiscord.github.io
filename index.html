	<h1>OPENCOURSEWARE DISCORD</h1>

	<p> This is the blog for the MIT OCW Discord Server that lists all the running courses, the upcoming courses, links to resources, video recordings and everything else from the server that's of necessity to be preserved. This is done for the sake of organising things in the server and to also give new members an idea about how things generally happen in the server.</p>
