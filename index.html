		<h1>OPENCOURSEWARE DISCORD</h1>
	</header>

	<p> This is the blog for the MIT OCW Discord Server that lists all the running courses, the upcoming courses, links to resources, video recordings and everything else from the server that's of necessity to be preserved. This is done for the sake of organising things in the server and to also give new members an idea about how things generally happen in the server.</p>

	<p>The server is a place for enthusiastic learners who intend to cover advanced STEM courses in a self-directed manner. We run courses from freshman level up until graduate level. Courses are not to be taught in a lecturer-student manner, rather the focus is on trying to grasp the material directly through one's own effort and to do that in a group of others coming from varying backgrounds. We've had participants from high school students, graduate students, professionals and self-taught learners. Thus, the goal of the server is to not only encourage others for self-directed learning of material that's conventionally to be expected in an academic environment (college, university etc.) but to also encourage an environment of like-minded people who would be directed into a single goal irrespective of the high-degree of variation they happen to have in their background.</p>
